All configuration files are in the srcs folder.
The Makefile is at the root and builds the application using docker-compose.yml.
Each service (nginx, wordpress, mariadb) has its own Dockerfile in requirements.
Use Debian as the base image, which is allowed.
No pre-built images are pulled except for Debian.
Each service runs in its own container, as defined in docker-compose.yml.
NGINX is configured for TLSv1.2/1.3 only (nginx.conf, server.conf).
WordPress uses php-fpm only (www.conf), no nginx.
MariaDB runs alone (50-server.cnf), no nginx.
Two volumes are defined for database and WordPress files, mapped to /home/login/data (replace login with your username).
A custom bridge network connects the containers.
Containers are set to restart on failure.
No infinite loops or hacky patches in entrypoints.
WordPress setup script creates two users, with the admin username not containing forbidden words (setup.sh).
Domain name is set via the Makefile
Passwords are not hardcoded in Dockerfiles; environment variables are used.
NGINX is the only entry point, exposed on port 443.
